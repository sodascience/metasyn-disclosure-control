# Metasyn disclosure control

This is a plugin for the [metasyn](https://github.com/sodascience/metasyn) Python library. Metasyn
is a package to create synthetic data for tabular datasets automatically.
While the base metasyn package is generally good at protecting privacy, it doesn't adhere to any
standard level of privacy. For example, the uniform distributions in the base package will simply find
the lowest and highest values in the dataset, and use those as the boundaries for the uniform
distribution. In some cases the minimum and maximum values can be disclosive. That is why we have
built this plugin that implements the disclosure control standard.

## Rule of Thumb

In this package we have implemented the "rule of thumb" as described in the
[European guidelines](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cros/system/files/dwb_standalone-document_output-checking-guidelines.pdf)
for output checking. The main idea behind the rule of thumb is that it is on the safe side
of what you are allowed to disclose. If you follow the rule of thumb then the idea is that
the output should be considered privacy conserving, without the need for a specialist that
looks at the specific context.

## Current status of the plugin

Currently, there the disclosure plugin is work in progress. Especially in light of this, we disclaim
any responsibility as a result of using this plugin. For most of the distributions
the micro-aggregation technique is used. This technique pre-averages a sorted version of the data,
which then supplied to the original fitting mechanism. The idea is that during this pre-averaging
step, we ensure that the rule of thumb is followed, so that the fitting method doesn't need to do
anything in particular. While, from a statistical point of view, we are losing more information than
we probably need, it should ensure the safety of the data. 

Below we have summarized the status for each of the variable types:

### Discrete

It technically works, but a new micro-aggregation algorithm specifically for integers might yield
better and more consistent results. Currently are implemented:

- DiscreteUniform, UniqueKey, Poisson

### Continuous

No current issues, following are implemented:

- Uniform, TruncatedNormal, Normal, LogNormal, Exponential

### Datetime

Implemented:

- UniformDate, UniformTime, UniformDateTime

### String

Currently only Faker distribution is implemented (which is the same as the metasyn base package,
since the distribution is not fit to any data). The regex distribution is currently not implemented.

### Categorical

A safe version of the multinoulli distribution is implemented. There is still some discussion on what to do if the dominance
rule is violated.
