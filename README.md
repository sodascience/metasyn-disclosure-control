[![Project Status: WIP – Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

A privacy plugin for [metasyn](https://github.com/sodascience/metasyn), based on statistical disclosure control (SDC) rules of thumb as found in the following documents:

- The [SDC handbook](https://securedatagroup.org/guides-and-resources/sdc-handbook/) of the Secure Data group in the UK
- The Data Without Boundaries document [Guidelines for output checking](https://wayback.archive-it.org/12090/*/https:/cros-legacy.ec.europa.eu/system/files/dwb_standalone-document_output-checking-guidelines.pdf) (pdf)
- Statistics Netherlands' output guidelines

While producing synthetic data with [metasyn](https://github.com/sodascience/metasyn) is already a great first step towards protecting privacy, it doesn't adhere to official standards. For example, fitting a uniform distribution will disclose the lowest and highest values in the dataset, which may be a privacy issue in sensitive data. This plugin solves these kinds of problems.

> Currently, the disclosure control plugin is work in progress. Especially in light of this, we disclaim
any responsibility as a result of using this plugin. 

## Installing the plugin

The easiest way to install the plugin is by using pip. 

In your terminal (with the Python environment that you want to install to active) run the following command: ``pip install git+https://github.com/sodascience/metasyn-disclosure-control.git``. 
Alternatively, to install it within a Jupyter notebook: ``!pip install git+https://github.com/sodascience/metasyn-disclosure-control.git``.

## Usage

Basic usage for our built-in titanic dataset is as follows:

```py
from metasyn import MetaFrame, demo_dataframe
from metasyncontrib.disclosure import DisclosurePrivacy
from metasyncontrib.disclosure.string import DisclosureFaker

df = demo_dataframe("titanic")

spec = [
    {"name": "PassengerId", "distribution": {"unique": True}},
    {"name": "Name", "distribution": DisclosureFaker("name")},
]

mf = MetaFrame.fit_dataframe(
    df=df, 
    dist_providers=["builtin", "metasyn-disclosure"],
    privacy=DisclosurePrivacy(),
    var_specs=spec
)
mf.synthesize(5)
```

```
shape: (5, 13)

## Implementation details
The rules of thumb, roughly, are: 

- at least 10 units
- at least 10 degrees of freedom
- no group disclosure
- no dominance

For most distributions, we implemented micro-aggregation. This technique pre-averages a sorted version of the data, which then supplied to the original fitting mechanism. The idea is that during this pre-averaging step, we ensure that the rules of thumb are followed, so that the fitting method doesn't need to do anything in particular. While from a statistical point of view, we are losing more information than we probably need, it should ensure the safety of the data.
